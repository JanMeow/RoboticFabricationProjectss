# RoboticFabricationProjectss


"Two projects using ABB robots for 3D printing with clayshooting or inflated PLG plasatic, both these two technologies were developed in ETH. 
The design of the 3D object is done using 3D software Rhino, the idea is to apply these technology into the actual building industry and programming robots with specific end-effector to produce affordable and fast housing solutions for humans."

"The workflow includes a computational 3D design on different building elements and then translate it into coordinates and parsed into a JSON file which is then sent
to the ABB robot using docker"
